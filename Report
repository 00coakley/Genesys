# The goal of this project was to create three separate functions within the existing code. My role was to make a functional pathway and integration site so that when
# group members were finished with their piece of the puzzle, they would have little difficulty getting it onto Github which was our primary workplace.
# I was able to help our members have ease of access to the code and to one anothers work. I was able to work with each group individualy and help get them
# pointed towards a direction and we were able to work together to get each of their functions integrated sucessfully into the code. Overall we were able to get the 
# save button added to the main page with Carson and Riley's project, fix a csv file issue with Sophie and Noah's group, and finally had a slope function that can 
# be added directly into the code at a later date, or used independently.
